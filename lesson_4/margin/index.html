            According to wikipedia, udacity is "Udacity is a for-profit
            educational organization founded by Sebastian Thrun, David
            Stavens, and Mike Sokolsky offering massive open online courses
            (MOOCs)."

            put simply, udacity is an online learning platform offering free
            or cheap access to quality education in computer science. It is a
            resource that I encourage anyone intrested in software technology
            to check out. If you like SPOC, Udacity is for you!
